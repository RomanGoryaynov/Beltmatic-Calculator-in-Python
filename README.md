I noticed that there are calculators on other platforms, but I was not comfortable using them. So I decided to create my own calculator in Python. 
I decided to share my project, because there are people who, like me, may not know how to run other calculators. The main features of my calculator include:
1.The ability to show all types of solutions to the number.
2.The ability to select the maximum and minimum available numbers.
